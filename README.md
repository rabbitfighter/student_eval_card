# student_eval_card
HTML/js page that allows teachers to create student evaluation cards for the teacher whose class the student will be moving to in the next school year. The teachers made these by hand in the past but wanted to be able to fill them out/print them from their laptops. This is designed to print on 8 x 5 inch cards. 

Just upload to any web server and it should work. I have only tested it with Chrome.
