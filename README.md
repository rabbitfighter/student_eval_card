# student_eval_card
HTML/js page that allows teachers to create student evaluation cards for the teacher whose class the student will be moving to in the next school year. 

This is a simple web page that I created for the teachers at the school where I work. They made these by hand in the past but wanted to be able to fill them out/print them from their laptops. 

Just upload to any web server and it should work. I have only tested it with Chrome.
